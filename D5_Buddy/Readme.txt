D5 Buddy
A Arcade Stage 5 Card Editor
By PockyWitch
Version 0.5 Hotfix1 BETA

Features:
- Change Name, Rank, DPoints.
- Change all 3 cars, their colors and get them up to fulltune (MT, AT) or last step tune (for cars that have multiple engine options!)

Coming Soon (TM):
- Avatar Editing

Changelog 0.5 Hotfix:
- Fix Selected Car List filling up when repeatedly loading cards
- Automatically convert names to fullwidth text to keep original game spacing
- Filter open card dialogue to .crd files
- Automatically clear visual tuning parts to avoid bugs (only when actually changing car, and when "Keep Visual Tuning" isn't checked)

How to use:
Click the load card button, then point at the InidCrd000.crd in your d5 directory. Make a backup first in case anything goes wrong though!
Just change whatever you want to change, then click save and boot up the game.

Notes:
This is a beta, for real this time. I mean it. 

Please make sure to read the warning when checking "Keep Visual Parts". 

Big thanks to M2rtra and Alexvgz for helping test the first beta release.
