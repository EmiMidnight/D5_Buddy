D5 Buddy
A Arcade Stage 5 Card Editor
By PockyWitch
Version 0.5 BETA

Features:
- Change Name, Rank, DPoints.
- Change all 3 cars, their colors and get them up to fulltune (MT, AT) or last step tune (for cars that have multiple engine options!)

Coming Soon (TM):
- Avatar Editing

How to use:
Click the load card button, then point at the InidCrd000.crd in your d5 directory. Make a backup first in case anything goes wrong though!
Just change whatever you want to change, then click save and boot up the game.

Notes:
This is a beta, for real this time. I mean it. 
There's a chance that, changing the car in a slot can break if the original car you are replacing has a lot of visual tuning parts installed.
I haven't been able to test it very much, and the small tests I did were working but I do get a bad feeling about how this works so,
if you do have a car with a ton of visual mods and the card editor works fine for you (after changing the car to another one)
Please let me know so my soul can rest happily.
